# Linear Regression
The contents of this project are heavily inspired by the machine learning course presented at Stanford by Andrew Ng. But using Python instead. I used the NumPy library to work with N-dimensional arrays and matplotlib for plotting.
In part 1, the goal is to implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. The file houses.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. It should use this data to help select which city to expand to next.
